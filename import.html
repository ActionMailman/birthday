		<h1 id="show-title">Your Importance to the Club</h1>
		<p>Among your strengths of being genuinely intelligent and a much more responsible person than I, you're a fantastic member of the club. Thanks to the work you've done, we've gotten enough members to the point where we actually need to get rid of them at this point. Like seriously, there were like twenty eight ambassadors as of the club at it's most populated, and there probably would have been even more if we didn't disable the invite links and scrub away the reddit comment</p>
		<p>That one competition we did is also in part thanks to you. Especially since you took part in getting a ton of people in the club around that time. You've made your fair share of drawings for the cause which were pretty cool, and you've done a little photoshop here and there, along with some other creative contribution. We've also had some pretty enjoyable experiences that you were part of. Remember that time <span id="redacted">DANCE</span> tried to stage a one-man mutiny against the entire club? Or all the times Scootbert got very, uh, conversational? Good times.</p>
		<p>Your greatest achievments, however, are yet to be seen. We have been given the arduous task of creating a text representative of all creation. A scripture that illuminates all, giving the final, resolute answers to all questions of metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetic. This is not an easy undertaking, but we, the ones accursed with the knowledge of the stars must move forward with it regardles.</p>
		<p>Everything aside, I'd just like to thank you for being a good friend in general.</p>
