		<p>So I made this website for your birthday. This was probably too much work that I did to finish this. Especially considering that I'm not even sure where the "make a website for birthday" level is in a friendship. But you know what, I needed something for my portfolio, because clients really can't make up their minds about stuff like this. You drew some stuff for my birthday, so I thought to myself "what kinda thing could I do for your birthday?" So I brainstormed. I'm kinda absolutely terrible at drawing so that's out of the question.</p>

		<p>I'm also a terrible songwriter as it turns out, so that's gonna be a no. Then it hit me, I made a website that one time. I could just make a website or something. I have access to a domain that I could upload the front end content to, and I know that if I want to make some money off of that skill, I need to make some designs beforehand to show my capability to future clients.</p>

		<p>About a day worth of work later, and here we are. Happy Birthday, I guess. Eighteen is a sort of big number, and with it comes a lot of weird socially imposed responsibilities. But out of anyone could work out the messy, complicated problems that come with arbitrarily assigned adulthood, you would probably be fine. Maybe.</p> <p> I hope this coming year is good to you, and I wish you luck with the future.</p>
